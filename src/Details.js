    about: `I’m currently pursuing an MS Degree in Computer Science at Brown University, 
    where my work spans software engineering and applied AI. During my intern at Huawei, 
    I focused on system infrastructure and orchestration, helping services become 
    more reliable and scalable across platforms. I’ve also built AI products, 
    including a medical chatbot during my co-op in Epic, and I’m exploring dataset 
    distillation research at Brown to make models more efficient with less data. 
    I’m driven by the challenge of translating AI ideas into robust, user-centered 
    systems that make a tangible difference.`,
